Thanks to @nlou for showing how to integrate tiles into this project. 

# Infinity

I used the infinite world of this assignment to represent a forest tree scene.

# Variation in Space

Honestly, there arent a ton of variations in space, there are 2 sets of trees with 3 ever green and 4 snowy trees.
Each tree in each group has an equal opportunity to be generated. E.g. each ever green is 1 in 3, and snow is 1/4. Differences can be hard to tell though.
# Variations in Key

The key in this piece plays a gigantic role. Each different key controls the tree density of the piece. Changing the key will control how many trees are generated and where.

I really recommend trying a bunch of them to see how drastically the piece changes.


# Signs of Life

There is a simulated snowstorm that covers the piece. The snow particles drift similarly to the ones around them. They also lose their brightness at different rates, really creating some interesting diversity.
